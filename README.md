# LeapMotionProject

This repo is to store the artifacts which are used in the Monash University (Semester 2, 2016) FIT3036 Computer Science Project, which revolves around the upcoming tech - Leap Motion.

The final product will be a application of Leap Motion which will simplify and enhance a university/undergraduate level student's experience in learning and understanding a certain programming concept. In my case, this will likely be the Tree data structure. This is because of my personal experience in having a hard time understanding the extended concepts of Trees (i.e. Red-Black Tree, B-Tree, AVL Tree, etc). 

If there is enough time to implement more functionality, I would like to extend the application to be able to support Heaps and other data structres.
